business_criticality: important
management_summary_comment: |
  Important security data is ingested to show a view of the world in DfE.
abuse_cases:
  Sensitive-Key-Compromise: >
    As an attacker, I would like to steal sensitive keys used by the Rust ingester to enable me to get hold of sensitive data regarding the DfE estate.
  Information-Dislosure: >
    As an attacker, I'd like to access SplunkCloud to view the dashboards containing the risk and compliance levels of sensitive services.
  Denial-of-Service: >
    As an attacker, I'd like to disrupt the service to prevent data from being ingested.
  Data-Poisoning: >
    As an attacker, I'd like to forward data to SplunkCloud to poison the data and cause reputational damage.
security_requirements:
  Strict key management: Ensure that keys are properly secured and managed to ensure that only the Rust function app can access them.

    origin: DfE
    owner: DfE
    quantity: very-few
    confidentiality: strictly-confidential
    integrity: critical
    availability: important
    justification_cia_rating: The Rust Function App secrets are at least rated as 'critical' in terms of integrity, because any access to the keys or modification of the code would reveal sensitive system information across the whole estate.
  Splunk data:
    id: splunk-data
    description: Splunk data contains all the vulnerability and compliance data for each system we collect from (Azure, AWS, GitHub, O365).
    usage: business

    owner: DfE
    quantity: many
    confidentiality: strictly-confidential
    integrity: critical
    availability: operational
    justification_cia_rating: The splunk data is confidential due to the amount of vulnerability and compliance data for systems across the org.

        description: The biggest risk to SSPHP is the leaking of sensitive system data, this is most likely to happen within Splunk due to the high number of users, including those from a third party supplier.
        impact: Serious reputational damage, potential targeting of sensitive assets.
        asvs: V4.1 - General Access Control, V2.2 General Authenticator Security
        cheat_sheet: 
        action: Gaining unauthorised access to Splunk and retrieving sensitive vulnerability and compliance data.
        mitigation: Restrict number of users, continuously audit users, implement robust leavers processes, audit and alert on sensitive actions, hold audit logs for 90+ days, follow principle of least privilege, enforce SSO where possible, where SSO not possible - enforce MFA.
        check: 
        function: operations
        stride: information-disclosure
        detection_logic: User logs in after X amount of inactivity, User exfiltrates data from Splunk, User does not have MFA, User doesn't log in for X amount of time.
        risk_assessment: The likelihood of this happening is medium as users are strictly trusted staff, the impact is high due to the sensitivity of data.
        false_positives: Third party company doesn't keep DfE updated with staff churn.
